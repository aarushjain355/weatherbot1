An autonomous ROS Arduino robot that travles and avoids obstacles depending on the weather conditions of the city of your choice. Integreates a  user-interactive GUI component which asks the user for the city they would like the robot to travel through. Implements a simple obstacle avoidance algorithm and a PID control loop. Includes computer vision algorithms and models to analyze the user's actions and detect when they are hot, cold, neutral, or there in an emenrgency with the mediapipe Pose model. Based on this, the software sends service requests to the arduino where hardware components are activated to signal the acknowledgement of the condition.
